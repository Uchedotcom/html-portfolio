    <p>I know what you are probably thinking, "Is he crazy? Why is he inviting me for a birthday that is still about 6 months away?", but better early than late, right? Plus if i prepare now, there will be less work to do by February</p>
    <p>This might equally surprise you, but I have even gone as far as baking the cake already and I promise you, its absolutely gorgeous! Take a look, It's my favorite flavour; chocolate!</p>
